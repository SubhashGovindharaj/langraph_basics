# 🧠 LangGraph Basics – Getting Started with LangGraph & LangChain

This project demonstrates the **basics of using LangGraph**, a powerful library from the LangChain ecosystem that lets you build **stateful multi-agent applications and chains** using graph structures.

LangGraph enables you to represent your LLM workflows as **state machines**, making it ideal for more complex decision-making, agent routing, and multi-step dialogue flows.
